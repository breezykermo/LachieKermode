# I Rest My Eyes

I haven't formalized my thoughts as written reflection for an unmanageable amount of time. My last proper memory of it is the unpublished piece I wrote at Nepi's beginning, roughly a month ago. Reading back over it, it seems limited, unfounded. As does an informal reflection on the thoughts to which Nepi living has surfaced, and those it has kept hidden.

My thoughts present themselves as less complex. I am trying to understand why or how. The absolving explanation is that complexity in the here-and-now arrives in the social, and my social here does not speak English. There is no friction in these words. They are unreceived, obligatory, cold. They have time to sit, install, lose relevance. They are not asked questions. They barely remember how to ask questions themselves. It is not that no-one is listening, but that I am speaking to no-one. Heat generates in the friction between a specific you and me, when we become more than abstract.

I masturbate thinking of the trituration that once kept me up at night. My body and I speak more often, both being lonely. I look in the mirror a lot, wondering what other bodies feel when they see me. I rest my eyes in women in cafes. I have never really known how to approach desire. I fear and long to be caught watching. To be approached, identified as an elite in culture's twisted hierarchies, and happen out of them, in some quiet cottage bedroom. Not only for sex, but also for reason, God forbid love.

I don't think there is a solution to the riddle of self. Loneliness is not a single leaky pipe, it is an aggregate of the distance between each and every pipe in the plumbing. The abstract is a framework for thinking about the physical, or for thinking about some smaller abstract. What we judge as abstractly 'smaller' is our own estimate, if we own what we suckle from culture's tits.

The only music that wrote me this year was prompted by an email, riddled with English words and past complexities. It is not simple here; I am simply not brave enough to shatter the aristocratic court of past ideology. As a result I am confined to imagination. In coffee there are countless colors every morning, in code there is a catastrophe of connections, but in music and lyrics there only seems to be missing space.

Two days later I am leaving Nepi, for Rome. The barista at my local asks if she can come with me. I say it's probably not on the cards.
