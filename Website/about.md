Originally from Auckland, New Zealand, I am **roughly** a digital nomad at the moment; though in September 2016 I'll continue my studies in Computer Science at Princeton University. I'm a full stack developer, particularly interested in frontend functional JavaScript, via React & React Native. See [my resume](http://lachlankermode.com/page/resume) for more about how I develop. See [this piece](/pieces/i-would-like-to-be-an-open-source-software) for info on how the practice of software development is relevant to me in a personal way. See my [other pieces](http://lachlankermode.com) for the other thoughts I have tried to code in writing.

This website is and will always be unfinished. I keep it as a practice, not as a product. If you have comments, improvements, or any other form of feedback, please feel free to create an issue on my [OpenSourceMe repo](https://github.com/OpenSourceMe/LachieKermode/issues) (this site is simply an expression of that repo--any changes made there will be reflected in this site). If you've never used Github before, [this article](http://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/) is a good place to start!

If you're a developer, feel free to check out the [source code](https://github.com/OpenSourceMe/Website) for this engine, which is all open source and configurable, if you like the idea of hosting your own site with Github as a content management system.
